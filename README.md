Jornalero is an innovative and sustainable new platform in which people who often are underrepresented in the greater labor market can achieve greater professional success, while providing a service which is useful for the average person.

We have noticed that often many day laborers in our community will be stuck standing outside of hardware stores (such as Home Depot or San Lorenzo Lumber) looking for work and jobs to complete, and often are left standing out for hours without a single offer. Then often the offers these people receive are poorly paid and scarce.

Jornalero solves this problem by following a similar model as Fiverr or Doordash, in which someone who is looking for landscaping, handyman, or construction services, can put out an offer along with the total compensation and required amount of people. Ideally laborers would have a profile that can be viewed, and the requestor can choose based on this.

From the laborer side, we would like the ability for them to post their qualifications and profiles, and then accept the offers. We would like for these people to be able to upload pictures of their work to show off their abilities and have a profile similar to the one of an Uber driver, with a profile picture, rating, and samples of their work.

The word Jornalero is an old Spanish word for “day laborer”, and we think that this would best serve our hispanic-american community which is often underrepresented in technology. We would like to integrate bilingual support to ensure ease of use for both parties, and ensure that these people who are often overlooked by greater society can have a chance as well. Through this platform we want to address these social inequalities, and ensure that we are leveraging technology to help us promote circular economy processes in our local communities. 

Jornalero could be a platform in which very skilled individuals can showcase their abilities, build a portfolio for their work, and eventually be able to integrate into society with more stable employment. Trade jobs are very highly in demand, and we want to have a platform that can fulfill this demand while actively helping a disadvantaged community.

So let’s use Jornalero to help these Jornaleros make their work known, while making a platform that’ll make it easy for anyone to find someone to trim their lawn or fix their fence!
